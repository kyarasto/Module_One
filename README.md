On your github repo add a readme that contains a short description and key information on reproducibility/installation/usage. 
This key information should be sufficient for a knowledge third party, outside the class, to replicate your design. 
This readme can be a subset of the material used in your blog post.

## How To Use

#### Loading the code onto the TTGO

To load the code found in the _moduleIOneInstall.ino into file the ESP32, open the Ardunio IDE and install the esp32 by Espressif in the boards manager. Then install the TFT_eSPI libaray in "Manage Libraries" found in the Tools tab.

Once the steps above are done you can create a new sketch and add the code in the _moduleIOneInstall.ino file of this repo and upload onto your ESP32. If you have trouble or errors with the upload make sure to go to "Tools" and then "Upload Speed" and change the upload speed to 115200.
